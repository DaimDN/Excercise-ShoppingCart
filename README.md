## Anything you want to tell us?

I assumed to Build a Shopping Cart using Rest API intially however then I have preferred using Local Storage Session of the Virtual Machine (Browser ). I have to take a professional descision to make sure that the build Application was to be used by Many people simultaneously therefore Session is really Important that wokring with a Rest API.
